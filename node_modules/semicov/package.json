It generates html [report like that](http://1602.ws/railwayjs/test-coverage)\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install semicov\n\n## It works only...\n\n...only if your code has semicolons. And it will break badly-written javascript:\n\n```javascript\nif (condition) doSomething();\nelse doSomethingElse();\n```\n\nSo, basically it should work very well for any code passed following [jslint](http://www.jslint.com) validations:\n\n- [semicolons](http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#semicolon)\n- [required blocks](http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#required)\n\n## Usage\n\nPut following line before very first line of your code\n\n    var semicov = require('semicov');\n    semicov.init('lib', 'My Awesome Lib Name'); // First argument 'lib' is name of dir with code\n    process.on('exit', semicov.report);\n\nAnd it will generate `./coverage/index.html` for you.\n\n## MIT License\n\n```\nCopyright (C) 2013 by Anatoliy Chakkaev <mail [åt] anatoliy [døt] in>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
